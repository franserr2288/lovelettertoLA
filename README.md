Dev Notes: 
Need to do more research to get an idea of where soft/hard power is in the city, I don't know the exact topology other than the obvious positions. Hopefully open data sources expose their info or I'll have to scrape them = brittle


cicd pipelines are stood up, only infra that is tightly coupled to whatever features i want will be necessary now. I don't want more shared infra, annoying to manage. 

finish manual testing for ingestion, see if you need to change consumption pattern
